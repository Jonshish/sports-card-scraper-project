create seperate database for the images adn titles. seperate from the card data itself
on front-end, display image from the image database as long as the titles match

create and add an index key value (i.e. 'efgd456' in card_img matches 'efgd456' in card_data) to match the data to the image.. might have to convert everything to JSON

PostgreSQL will handle adding Unique Identifier code to each row of JSON data
